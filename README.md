# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is information about food orders and deliveries from NYC restaurants, specifically those that go through the delivery app Foodhub. Here is the link to the dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/food-ordering-and-delivery-app-dataset

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a pie chart that shows the most popular cuisine types by the number of orders. Each cuisine type is specified by its own unique color and identified in the legend.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which are the most popular cuisine types ordered?
 
 * Is there a correlation between delivery/preparation time and customer ratings?
 
 * Which restaurants receive the most orders? Which restaurants earn the most money from orders?
 
 * Are food orders/deliveries more common on weekends or weekdays?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

I am concerned about the difficulty of creating a toggle button that will filter the data. I am also worried that the scatterplot may not show a clear correlation, and in that case I may have to consider another visualization in its place.

## Milestones
Week 7 - Find way to effectively display counts + labels on pie chart

Week 8 - Create barcharts without filter toggles

Week 9 - Create scatterplot/create new idea for that visualization

Week 10 - Implement toggle feature on barchart

Week 11 - Implement toggle feature on scatterplot/new visualization

Week 12 - Work on adding additional visualization components if necessary

Week 13 - Work on visualization aesthetics (color + text themes) 

Week 14 - Finalize visualizations
